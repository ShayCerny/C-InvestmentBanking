# Investment Banking Console App

## Overview

This project is a console-based investment banking application designed to help users calculate their potential yearly interest earnings and the total balance at the end of each year. Users input their initial investment amount, monthly deposits, the number of years they plan to invest, and the interest rate. The app then provides a detailed spread of the interest earned and the total balance for each year.

### Problem It Solves
Managing investments can be complex, especially for those without financial expertise. This app simplifies the process by providing a clear breakdown of how compound interest works over time, making it easier for users to plan their investments and understand how different factors (like monthly deposits or interest rates) affect their financial growth.

## Project Highlights

### What Was Done Particularly Well
One of the key strengths of this project is its simplicity and clarity. The app is designed to be user-friendly, guiding the user through a step-by-step input process. The calculations for compound interest are accurate and offer an easy-to-read summary of yearly earnings, helping users to visualize their long-term financial growth.

### Areas for Enhancement
While the app functions as expected, there are opportunities for improvement:

- **Error Handling**: Adding more robust input validation, such as handling non-numeric input or negative numbers, would improve the user experience.
- **Performance**: Implementing more efficient algorithms for large data sets (e.g., simulating long-term investments over several decades) would improve performance.
- **Security**: Though this is a console app, adding features like encryption for sensitive financial data would make the application more secure.

These improvements would make the app more resilient, secure, and scalable for a wider range of users.

### Challenging Aspects and Solutions
The most challenging part of this project was accurately calculating compound interest with both annual and monthly deposits. Ensuring that the math logic worked across different time frames required careful attention to detail and numerous test cases. To overcome this, I relied on well-documented financial formulas and tested the calculations with known values to ensure accuracy.

### Transferable Skills
The skills developed during this project, such as handling user inputs, performing complex mathematical operations, and formatting data for readability, are easily transferable to other coding projects or coursework. The ability to build clear, maintainable code that serves a real-world need, like financial planning, can be applied in various fields, especially in data processing and user-centered applications.

### Maintainability and Adaptability
I followed coding best practices by using descriptive variable names, consistent formatting, and clear, modular functions. The code is designed to be adaptable for future upgrades, such as adding new investment options or changing the calculation formulas. Comments are included throughout the code to guide future developers (or myself) when making changes.
